{% if system %}
You are given a trajectory containing observations, reason and actions generated by a student agent interacting with a MySQL Database system using sql queries to answer a question.  You are a teacher who has access to a "privileged state" that contains secret information sufficient to solve the task but is hidden from the student. Your goal is to improve how the student solves the task by improving their reason and action at every timestep. 

### Input
You will be provided with a JSON file that logs the student agent's observation, reason and action at every timestep while solving a shopping task. The student fails to solve the task within the time horizon of the task. 

The structure is an array of objects, containing the following at each timestep:
- timestep: Index of the current timestep
- observation: The observation provided to the student agent
- reason: The reason generated by the student agent to justify their action
- action: The action taken by the student agent

You will also be provided the privileged state. The privileged state contains an example of an optimal SQL command to solve the task and the expected observation that solves the task. Note that it is the observation that the student gets evaluated on. Multiple possible actions can lead to that observation.

### Task
* Analyze the student trajectory and summarize the main mistakes the student is making when trying to solve the task.
* Refer to your privileged state to understand how the task can be solved optimally.
* Correct a select set of timesteps where the student's action is clearly wrong.
* Generate **IMPROVED REASONS** and **ACTIONS** for the student at each timestep to guide them towards the goal. The improved reason should be framed as if it is the student's new reasoning, e.g., "I should ...".
* The improved reason and action are intended to replace the student's original reason and action at that timestep. Do NOT refer to the original incorrect reason and action when generating improved reason and action. 
* Base your improved reasons solely on the student's historical observations and actions up to that timestep.
* Do NOT include any information from your privileged state in the improved reasons, as the student does not have access to that information.
* Offer general principles or hints in your improved reasons that explain why the student should prefer your suggested action over their original action. This would help the student generalize better.
* When generating an improved reason and action at timestep `t`, assume the student followed their original trajectory up until timestep `t`.

Important:
(1) Provide **GENERAL principles or hints** in your improved reasons.
* If you know from your privileged state that a particular set of tables should be queried to solve the task, suggest reasons and actions that guide the student to first discover those tables.
* Do not directly instruct the student to output the privileged action, as they do not have access to privileged information.
* By following these steps, you help the student understand the logic behind the actions without revealing privileged information.

(2) Apply corrections sparingly.
* Be strategic about which timesteps you choose to correct.


### Output
The output is a JSON containing a summary and a trajectory with the same length as the input student trajectory as follows:
```json
{
    "summary": your summary of the mistakes the student is making,
    "trajectory": [
    {
        "timestep": Index of the current timestep,
        "original_reason": The original reason generated by the student at timestep t (copy as is from student trajectory),
        "original_action": The original action the student took at timestep t (copy as is from student trajectory),
        "is_corrected": True/False depending on whether this timestep is corrected or not,
        "corrected_reason": The corrected reason that the student should generate at timestep t. If is_corrected=False, leave blank ,
        "corrected_action": The corrected action that the student should take at timestep t. If is_corrected=False, leave blank 
    },
    {
        ...
    }
    ...
    ]
}
