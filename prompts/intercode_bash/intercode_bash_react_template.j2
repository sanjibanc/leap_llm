{% if mode == 'input' %}
You are an intelligent agent. Your objective is to interact with a Bourne Shell system using bash queries to answer a question. 

You are given as input the current observation that shows the current bash output. Your goal is to generate the action to take at this time step along with the reason for taking the action. 

Please follow these general instructions:
* The action can be of two types:
(1) bash code that gets executed on the Bourne Shel system
(2) submit, which indicates that the previous observation is the answer
* Use reason to rationalize your current situation to decide your next action
* Consult the history of previous observations and actions to see what actions you have tried already so as to not repeat your actions.
* Do NOT repeat the same action as the last action in your observation_action_history. It's going to yield the same result. 

Here are some examples of epsiodes

TIMESTEP: 0
OBSERVATION: 
Convert the first 16 characters in "/testbed/textfile7.txt" to a single hexadecimal value
REASON: 
I can use the `xxd` command to get a hexdump of the /textbed/textfile7.txt file
ACTION: 
xxd -p -l 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt
TIMESTEP: 1
OBSERVATION:
/bin/bash: line 1: xxd: command not found
REASON:
Seems like xxd is not available. I can try to use `od` (octal dump) command to get a hexadecimal dump.
ACTION: 
od -A n -t x1 -N 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt
TIMESTEP: 2
OBSERVATION:  
54 65 78 74 20 66 69 6c 65 20 37 20 77 69 74 68
REASON: 
This command is showing the hexadecimal representation of the first 16 bytes, but it is not a single value.
I should try stitching together the values into one continuous string.
ACTION: 
od -A n -t x1 -N 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt | awk '{$1=$1;print}' | tr -d ' '
TIMESTEP: 3
OBSERVATION: 
546578742066696c6520372077697468
REASON: 
I've configured
ACTION: 
submit


TIMESTEP: 0
OBSERVATION:
Calculate a list of duplicate md5 sum hashes for all the ".java" files in the /testbed directory
REASON: Find all files with the `.java` extension in `testbed/`, then calculate the md5hash, sort them,
filter out duplicates, and only pick the first line of the hash.
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -d | cut -d' ' -f1
TIMESTEP: 1
OBSERVATION: 
REASON: Seems like this did not produce any results. I may have to use another command instead of cut
to pick out the hashes from the output string
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -Dw 32
TIMESTEP: 2
OBSERVATION: f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72  /testbed/Hello.java
f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72  /testbed/Hello1.java
f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72  /testbed/dir1/AnotherHello.java
REASON: This shows the output hashes and they have the same values, indicating that these files are duplicates.
However, the file names are also shown, which are not needed.
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -D -w 32 | cut -c 35-
TIMESTEP: 3
OBSERVATION: /testbed/Hello.java
/testbed/Hello1.java
/testbed/dir1/AnotherHello.java
REASON: This shows the file names exclusively, and no longer shows the hashes. It seems that the cut
command argument may not be the best choice for selecting file names.
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -D -w 32 | awk '{print $2}'
TIMESTEP: 4
OBSERVATION: /testbed/Hello.java
/testbed/Hello1.java
/testbed/dir1/AnotherHello.java
REASON: I use the awk command instead, but instead of printing out the hashes, it still prints out the file
names. I should select a different part of the output string instead of `$2`
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.java" -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -D -w 32 | awk '{print $1}'
TIMESTEP: 5
OBSERVATION: f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72
f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72
f32a3a97638afeb2ee2a15cfe335ab72
REASON: This prints out identical hashes, and based on previous observations, I know that these are hashes of
duplicates `.java` files from the `testbed/` directory. This should be correct. I will submit.
ACTION: 
submit

TIMESTEP: 0
OBSERVATION: 
print disk usage in human readable format of files or folders in /workspace
REASON: 
The `du` command is useful for printing out disk usage of a specific directory. I can use this to
display this information for the `workspace` directory
ACTION: 
du /workspace
TIMESTEP: 1
OBSERVATION: 
48	/workspace/dir1
8	/workspace/dir2/mysql
24	/workspace/dir2
100	/workspace
REASON: 
The default `du` command gives storage in a non-human readble font. I can use the -h option
of the du command to print storage size with bytes.
ACTION: 
du -h /workspace
TIMESTEP: 2
OBSERVATION: 
48K	/workspace/dir1
8.0K	/workspace/dir2/mysql
24K	/workspace/dir2
100K	/workspace
REASON: 
This gives me storage information for every folder under the workspace directory, but
I only need the storage for just the `workspace/` directory. The `-s` option should help with this.
ACTION: 
du -sh /workspace
TIMESTEP: 3
OBSERVATION: 
100K	/workspace
REASON: 
This shows data usage in human readable format for the `workspace` directory. I am finished.
ACTION: 
submit

TIMESTEP: 0
OBSERVATION: 
Count all the lines of all php files in the /testbed directory recursively
REASON: 
I should find the paths to all php files in the testbed directory, then apply the word
count command to each path.
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs wc -l
TIMESTEP: 1
OBSERVATION:  
 1 /testbed/dir1/info.php
 1 /testbed/hello.php
 2 total
REASON: 
This shows me too much information, I only need the total number of lines. I should add up
the lines together and output a single number.
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END{print total}'
TIMESTEP: 2
OBSERVATION: 
4
REASON: 
This total is wrong, it doesn't match the previous observation, where total is 2. I only
need to apply the word count command.
ACTION: 
find /testbed -name "*.php" -type f -exec cat {} + | wc -l
TIMESTEP: 3
OBSERVATION: 
2
REASON: 
The value is 2, which matches the initial observation that the total lines of php files in the
testbed directory is 2. I can submit.
ACTION: 
submit

TIMESTEP: 0
OBSERVATION: 
Create a hello.txt file in the /testbed directory and add the text "Hello world" to it.
REASON: 
I can first create a `hello.txt` file in the `testbed/` directory
ACTION: 
touch testbed/hello.txt
TIMESTEP: 1
OBSERVATION:
REASON: 
I should check that the file was created successfully.
ACTION: 
ls testbed/
TIMESTEP: 2
OBSERVATION: 
dir1/
dir2/
dir3/
hello.txt
files.txt
REASON: 
I can now add the "Hello world" text to the hello.txt file
ACTION: 
echo Hello world > hello.txt
TIMESTEP: 3
OBSERVATION:
REASON: 
I should check that the text was written successfully to the hello.txt file.
ACTION: 
cat testbed/hello.txt
TIMESTEP: 4
OBSERVATION: 
Hello world
REASON: 
The hello.txt file has been created successfully in the testbed/ directory, and it contains
the Hello World text. I can submit.
ACTION: 
submit
